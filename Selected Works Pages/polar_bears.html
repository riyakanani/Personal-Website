    <h5>Artist Statement:</h5>
    <p>
      The endangerment of polar bears is a cause that is important to a lot of people. 
      For example, people who care about arctic fish and consume fish are likely to be affected by polar bears becoming a threatened species. 
      This is because global warming has led to the melting of arctic ice which greatly impacts the food chain. 
      Polar bears play an integral role in keeping the ecosystem balanced. They rely on this ice to survive and hunt for seals. 
      Without arctic ice, polar bears canâ€™t hunt for seals, so they prey on arctic fish instead. 
      This has led to a decrease in the arctic fish population. As a result, the fishing industry suffers from the consequences of global warming. 
      Additionally, climate change activists are likely to care about this important cause since the extinction of polar bears is so closely tied to global warming. 
      Polar bears are just one of many animals that are being impacted by climate change, and they have been on thin ice for far too long. 
      We are looking to increase awareness, as well as provide the necessary information to demonstrate why polar bears are a more than worthy cause. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Being that polar bears have been listed as a threatened and endangered species since 2008, 
      there are a multitude of reasons why this project should be funded. They were listed under these topics due to the loss of its sea ice habitat, 
      and funding could help to curb climate change and help the polar bear adapt to its current conditions. But what horrendous conditions would justify the need for economic backing? 
      Well, as the ice retreats, polar bears have less time to hunt and get their food. If money were to be raised for the project, there would be a greater awareness which would assist 
      in helping the polar bears survive their current environment. They are currently experiencing a decline in body condition and efficiency, 
      as well as the fact that they are at their lowest in average body weights. Not only is this true, but there is an increase of contamination, 
      and a greater spread of disease. On top of this predicament, they are becoming even more endangered because as warmer weather comes, dens continue to collapse, 
      and families become separated. Without their families, cubs will not be able to grow up and provide for families of their own, 
      vastly decreasing the reproduction and survival rates of these animals. Without reproduction, the drifting ice keeps the polar bear species from living on as they could ultimately become extinct.

      When it comes to this project, we must use augmented reality as an immersive art form to show the larger picture. 
      While the viewers have likely heard about climate change and its impact, they have likely not been able to be immersed and 
      truly understand the harsh realities that polar bears face due to climate change. 
      This AR experience will help transform the viewers perception of climate change to be a tangible thing and invoke feelings of wanting change. 
      Our hope is to educate the viewers so that they can take action into their own hands, helping to convince those in power to prevent climate change.
      As far as our society and culture go, funding this project is important because these mammals have been historical creatures for centuries. 
      Climate change is a non-stop force that requires education so that people can react accordingly. 
      This artwork will not only demonstrate that there is a need for change, but show in detail how these creatures are being separated from what they need, 
      and cannot survive in their natural habitats for much longer. Despite the fact that the augmented reality project cannot identify movement corridors, 
      seasonal feeding times and areas, and cannot show specific resting areas during the free ice period, it can define an area for people to observe. 
      When an audience views the final product, they can see the culture and stigma surrounding polar bears, and how they need a new habitat that can support their needs.
