      <h4>Project Overview:</h4>
      <p>A Pacman-inspired game with integrated educational questions. 
        The player answers questions by "eating" certain objects in the game. 
        Each correct answer rewards the player with points, 
        and incorrect answers result in a loss of life. 
        Created for global food systems class, 
        specifically for the topic of obstacles to feeding 9.5 Billion.</p>
      <h4>Skills:</h4>
      <h5>Game Design:</h5>
      <p>I implemented the core mechanics of the Pac-Man game, 
        including character movement, ghost behaviors, and collision detection using p5.js.
      </p>
      <h5>Game Modes:</h5>
      <p>I created different game modes such as a welcome screen, gameplay, 
        question mode for answering educational prompts,
        and an end screen that displays the player's score and game-over message.
      </p>
      <h5>User Interface:</h5>
      <p> I designed the UI components to display the score, 
        lives, and educational questions, enhancing the user experience during gameplay.
      </p>

      <h5>Animation and Interaction:</h5>
      <p> I used p5.js' built-in functions to animate characters,
        trigger events upon interactions 
        (such as eating objects and encountering ghosts), 
        and implement the game’s dynamic elements, like the random movements of the ghosts.

      <h3><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/rkanani/sketches/rwOk-bNK2" target="_blank">Murder Mystery</a></h3>

      <p><strong>In collaboration with Alyssa Mazzone and Danika Perez:</strong></p>
      <h4>Project Overview:</h4>
      <p>
        In this murder mystery game, the user must play several minigames in order to collect hints to find the murderer. 
        This game uses concepts of On-screen Dynamics, Random Numbers, Text, and particle systems.
      </p>

      <h4>Skills:</h4>
      <h5>Screen Management:</h5>
      <p>Each screen function, like startScreen() and murdererScreen(), 
        dynamically renders content such as text, images, 
        and animations to set the game’s tone and narrative. 
        I added interactive visuals and sound cues to enhance the atmosphere, 
        including startScreen()'s animated title text and background 
        image that fades in and out, creating a suspenseful first impression.
      </p>
      <h5>User Interaction & Navigation:</h5>
      <p>The mouseClicked() function handles flexible navigation, 
        allowing players to move between screens by once they complete a task. 
        I also implemented resetGame() to randomize critical game elements, 
        ensuring varied gameplay with each reset.
      </p>
      <h5>Weapons Class and Particle System:</h5>
      <p>Designed a challenging "clicker game" where players must quickly click 
        the correct weapon type amidst other moving weapons in a particle system. 
        This minigame includes dynamic object creation and collision handling. 
        The render() function dynamically displays each weapon’s image based on type, 
        tinting colors as visual feedback for the player. 
        I implemented a physics engine in collide() to manage 
        interactions between weapons, ensuring they move naturally
         on the screen and respond accurately when clicked.
        I further supported the atmospere by adding sound effects 
        to heighten player engagement during gameplay.
