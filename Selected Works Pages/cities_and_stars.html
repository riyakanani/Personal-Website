    <!-- Arist Statement -->
    <h4>Artist Statement:</h4>
    <p>
      Our 360 degree VR experience was inspired 
      by a fictional city called Andria from Chapter 5 of Cities & the Sky of Invisible Cities. 
      Andria is a city that reflects the changes in the solar system. 
      For example, the streets follow the orbit of the planets and the buildings reflect the stars. 
      This was our main inspiration for our work. 
      We wanted to create a city that incorporates nature and the solar system in a peaceful way. 
      Our piece includes a stunning background with bamboo, mountains, greenery and houses inspired by beautiful asian architecture. 
      The sky is a burnt orange with unique planets, stars and a shooting comet. 
      Additionally, on the ground we have three women dressed in simple bodysuits floating around. 
      The stars in the sky follow the walking paths of the three women.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this VR experience, the viewer is placed in the center of this world. 
      They can turn around and view the background and the three women floating around them. 
      The three women represent female empowerment since they have direct control over the motion of the stars.
      Our work also represents the intersection between nature on earth and the planets in the solar system. 
      It also shows how humans are interconnected with nature and how our actions 
      can directly affect the physical world around us.

    <h4>My Contrubutions:</h4>
    <p>
      In this project, I was able to learn how to use animaition controllers, sound, and the principles of 3d design. 
      My team was assigned with finding many of the assets while I focused on bringing it all together through the 
      Unity development. This project gave me a good foundation on the basics of using VR in Unity.
