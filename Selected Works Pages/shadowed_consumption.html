    <h1>Shadowed Consumption</h1>

    <h2>artists' statement</h2>
    <p> Shadowed Consumption is a single player game where the topic is on consumerism/over-consumption. 
        The game starts with a character who goes to various different shopping places 
        (online shopping on their phone through social media platforms/online shops, 
        the grocery store, the mall, restaurant, coffee shop, etc). 
        The game follows a storyline where the character has friends and lives in this world and 
        travels to all these different locations and ultimately tries to obtain these items. 
        After the item they want is introduced, each shopping location transforms into a platform game 
        where the player must jump through/move through platforms to get the token/item. 
        In the game, there is also a happiness level bar that tracks their happiness level. 
        The plotline of the game is that the player is constantly feeling like they have to get more 
        and more things to fit in and ultimately increase their happiness. However, the world around them slowly becomes
        affected by their choices and they do not see the affect it has on their own mental health.

    <p>
      The aspects of this project where I had the most contrubutions

      I was able to learn about scene switcing using buttons and triggers, collision, and how to use installation design.
